# Day 1 – Get Your Starter Voice Agent Running

For Day 1, your objective is to:

- Step 1: Fork the repo (optional). **Get this starter repo running end-to-end** (backend + frontend) by following the setup and run instructions in `README.md`.

Alternatively

- Build a voice agent in your favorite language and framework.

 
- Step 2: **Successfully connect to the voice agent** in your browser and have a brief conversation.
- Step 3: **Record a short video** of your session talking with the agent.
- Step 4: **Post the video on LinkedIn** with a description of what you did for the task on Day 1. Also, mention that you are building voice agent using the fastest TTS API - Murf Falcon. Mention that you are part of the **“Murf AI Voice Agent Challenge”** and don't forget to tag the official Murf AI handle. Also use hashtags **#MurfAIVoiceAgentsChallenge** and **#10DaysofAIVoiceAgents**

Once your agent is running and your LinkedIn post is live, you’ve completed Day 1.
